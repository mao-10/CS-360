The app My Event Tracker tracks events for the user and gives the user notifications when an event is happening. Users must have or create an account that will keep track of their events. Events are displayed in a calendar form that can be browsed through to previous and future months. Login and signup features and screens were necessary as well so that events could be saved and tracked to individual users. These design choices kept in mind the user experience and considered what a user might expect based off other similar apps. When coding, I implemented one at a time so that I could prevent more errors. I tested my code by constantly running the app on the android emulator, and testing the features as they were coded. To overcome challenges, I had to do a lot of research to find solutions and new ideas. In my opinion, I was the most successful at implementing the calendar feature.
